# liri-node-app
language interpretation and recognition interface (backend).
This node app allows the user to search for songs, concerts, or movies by using four search commands:
--the concert-this `band` command searches for all upcoming concert appearances for the band name specified and returns the information to the user.
-- the spotify-this-song `song` command searches for songs with the song title and returns information about that song to the user.
--the movie-this `movie` command searches for movies with the title given by the user, and returns information about the movie.
-- the do-what-it-says command accesses the first two comma separated elements in a txt file and performs the spotify this song command on the second term.
this is a back end app, useful for pulling up relevant cultural data about movies, songs, and upcoming concerts. all current and future contributions to the project are the property of Matthew Dwinell.
